This is a gentle reminder that we are still waiting for you to complete the copy-editing step for "{article_title}". You can do it by following these steps:

1. Click on the Submission URL below.
2. Log into the Series and click on the File that appears in Step 1.
3. Open the downloaded submission.
4. Review the text, including copyediting proposals and Author Queries.
5. Make any copyediting changes that would further improve the text.
6. When completed, upload the file in Step 2.
7. Click on METADATA to check indexing information for completeness and accuracy.
8. Send the COMPLETE email to the editor and copyeditor.

Submission URL: {BASE_URL}/{JOURNAL}/author/submissionEditing/{article_id}
Username: {username}

This is the last opportunity to make substantial copyediting changes to the submission. The proofreading stage, that follows the preparation of the galleys, is restricted to correcting typographical and layout errors.

In order to conclude the publication process in due time, it is very important that you complete this task as soon as possible. If you are unable to undertake this work at this time or have any questions, please contact me. Thank you for your contribution to this Series.
